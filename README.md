# Tensorflow implementation of You Only Look Once

[![Video](https://i.imgur.com/szGut1Z.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJy0EI3hfSg)

An improvement of the implementation from @gliese581gg, with added training, testing and video parsing. We also used the VOC tools to parse the VOC dataset from @mprat.

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640

*Note:* the code needs cleaning (I didn't write it myself from scratch). I could not find the time and honestly, at this point, there are multiple better Open Source implementations of YOLOv2, so I don't see the point of doing it anymore.

# Installation

## Requirenments
- Tensorflow
- OpenCV2

## If you want to train the network yourself
`cd data_parsing`

`python data_parsing/setup.py install`

## If you want to use pre-trained weights
Download YOLO weight file from: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2JbaJSrWLpza08yS2FSUnV2dlE/view?usp=sharing].

Put the 'YOLO_small.ckpt' in the 'weight' folder of downloaded code.

## Uninstall (training)
`cd data_parsing`

`python setup.py develop --uninstall`

# Usage
## Images
`python network/YOLO_small_tf.py -fromfile "name of input file" -tofile_img "name of output file"`

## Videos
`python network/YOLO_small_tf.py -video "name of input file" -tofile_vid "name of output file"`
